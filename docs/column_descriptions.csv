"To","The code and name of the arrival airport."
"Stops","An array of strings, each being a stopover on the route."
"Op","The name of the aircraft's operator."
"OpCode","The operator's ICAO code."
"Sqk","The squawk as a decimal number (e.g. a squawk of 7654 is passed as 7654, not 4012)."
"Help","True if the aircraft is transmitting an emergency squawk."
"Dst","The distance to the aircraft in kilometres."
"Brng","The bearing from the browser to the aircraft clockwise from 0° north."
"WTC","The wake turbulence category of the aircraft - see enums.js for values."

"Tag","The user tag found for the aircraft in the BaseStation.sqb local database."
"Interested","True if the aircraft is flagged as interesting in the BaseStation.sqb local database."
"TT","Trail type - empty for plain trails, 'a' for trails that include altitude, 's' for trails that include speed."
"Trt","Transponder type - 0=Unknown, 1=Mode-S, 2=ADS-B (unknown version), 3=ADS-B 0, 4=ADS-B 1, 5=ADS-B 2."
"Year","The year that the aircraft was manufactured."
"Sat","True if the aircraft has been seen on a SatCom ACARS feed (e.g. a JAERO feed)."
"ResetTrail","True if the entire trail has been sent and the JavaScript should discard any existing trail history it's built up for the aircraft."
"HasSig","True if the aircraft has a signal level associated with it."
"Sig","The signal level for the last message received from the aircraft, as reported by the receiver. Not all receivers pass signal levels. The value's units are receiver-dependent."
"Fseen","Epoch format date and time the receiver first started seeing the aircraft on this flight.  Accurate for a single receiver, but as the plane is detected by different receivers, this will change."
